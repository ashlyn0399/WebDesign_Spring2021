    <h1>The Raven</h2>
  <br>
</body> <h5>Edgar Allan Poe</h5>
<br>
<br>
It was many and many a year ago,
<br>   In a kingdom by the sea,
<br>That a maiden there lived whom you may know
<br>   By the name of Annabel Lee;
<br>And this maiden she lived with no other thought
<br>   Than to love and be loved by me.
</p>
<br>I was a child and she was a child,
<br>   In this kingdom by the sea,
<br>But we loved with a love that was more than love
<br>   I and my Annabel Lee
<br>With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven
<br>   Coveted her and me.
</p>
<br>And this was the reason that, long ago,
<br>In this kingdom by the sea,
<br>A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
<br>   My beautiful Annabel Lee;
<br>So that her highborn kinsmen came
<br>   And bore her away from me,
<br>To shut her up in a sepulchre
<br>   In this kingdom by the sea.
</p>
The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
<br> Went envying her and me
<br>Yes!â€”that was the reason (as all men know,
<br>   In this kingdom by the sea)
<br>That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
<br>   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
</p>
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
<br>   Of those who were older than we
<br>   Of many far wiser than we
<br>And neither the angels in Heaven above
<br>   Nor the demons down under the sea
<br>Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
<br>   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
</p>
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
  <br> Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
<br>And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
<br>   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
<br>And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
<br>   Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
<br>   In her sepulchre there by the sea
<br>   In her tomb by the sounding sea.
